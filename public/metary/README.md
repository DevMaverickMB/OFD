Place your licensed Metary (home-03) theme CSS files here so the React app can load them.

Expected paths (you can match these names/paths):
- public/metary/css/plugins/default.css
- public/metary/css/styles.css

Once present, the app will auto-detect and load them at runtime.

Note: Do not hotlink/copy theme files unless you have the appropriate license.
